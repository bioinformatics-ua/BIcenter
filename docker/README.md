# Setup a Docker Enviroment
1. Create a `.env` file on `docker` directory, using `.env-example` as reference, setting all the necessary environment variables.
2. Build containers' images: `docker compose build` (this might take several minutes).
3. Bring up the containers: `docker-compose up -d`.
4. If you used the default ports, go to http://localhost:9000 to access BIcenter web platform.

## TL;DR
1. Create a `.env` file on this directory, using `.env-example` as reference, setting all the necessary environment variables.
2. Run `sh run.sh`, present in the root of this repository.
3. If you used the default ports, go to http://localhost:9000 to access BIcenter web platform.

## Troubleshooting and Workarounds
If you run into any problems, please check the following suggestions (bear in mind that most of these problems only happen if you choose not to use the docker environments and run the project yourself)
- In case of not being able to access any of the existent institutions:
    1. In the MySQL database used by BIcenter server, add the necessary items to User_Institution:
        ```mysql
        use teste;
        insert into User_Institution values (1, 1);
        insert into User_Institution values (1, 2);
        ```
    2. On the [web app](http://localhost:9000), preform the following operations:
          1. On the resources tab, add:
              * The **Data source(s)**. In here you should specify the databases you want to connect to.
              * The **Task(s)**. These are the tasks to which you can drag components into and define your flux.
          2. After having defined at least one task, choose it and add the components you desire into the graph editor and edit them as you see fit.

- In case of `sun.security.validator.ValidatorException` or `sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException`:
    1. Export the CA certificate from the specified URL

    2. Update java certificates with the specific certificate
        ```bash
        cd $JAVA_HOME/lib/security
        sudo keytool -import -trustcacerts -cacerts -alias sectigo -file path/to/file
        ```

- In the case of missing dependencies during the installation, such as:
    - sbt.ResolveException: unresolved dependency: com.bmdsoftware#sbt-rjs;1.0.9: not found
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/BMDSoftware/sbt-rjs.git
        cd sbt-rjs
        sbt publishLocal
        ```
    - sbt.ResolveException: unresolved dependency: com.bicou.sbt#sbt-hbs;1.0.8: not found
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/BMDSoftware/sbt-hbs.git
        cd sbt-hbs
        sbt publishLocal
        ```
    - sbt.ResolveException: unresolved dependency: jline#jline;2.11: not found
        - Add repositories into the file `~/.sbt/repositories` (This file may not exist) [more details](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42438544/sbt-installation-error-module-not-found-org-scala-sbt-ivyivy2-3-0-sbt-2cf13e)
